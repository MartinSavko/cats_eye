The aim of the project is to develop a computer vision system enhancing capabilities of cryogenic sample transfer systems by allowing detection of presence, location and possible anomalies of the samples located in the storage dewars.

The images used to train the detector can be downloaded from the the following link.

Download the compressed archive and unpack it to the experimental_images folder.

The pickled python dictionary images_information.pickle contains information about location of objects of interest in the images as well as information on the rough scale of the images (capturing entire dewar, lids or pucks).
